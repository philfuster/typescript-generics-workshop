## Generics

Generics allows you to write a function or a class that can work with any data type. This is a powerful feature of TypeScript that allows you to write reusable code.

To create a generic, you provide a Type Variable. A Type Variable is a placeholder for a type that will be provided when the generic is used.

```typescript
const identity = <T>(arg: T): T => {
  return arg;
};
```
